# Class-checker
Java program I created to check if a class was available

I created this program a while ago to try and change into a class section that was full. It essentially just runs through the steps to try to change into the section, and retries if it fails. I created it pretty quickly, and at one point the website changed, so the code is quite messy.

The .bat file was just to make development easier.
